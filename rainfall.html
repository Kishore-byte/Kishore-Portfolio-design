    <h1>Rainfall Prediction</h1>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Rainfall prediction is a critical aspect of meteorology, agriculture, and disaster management.
        Accurate rainfall predictions can help mitigate the adverse effects of natural disasters, optimize agricultural
        practices, and manage water resources effectively. With advancements in technology, machine learning (ML) has
        become a powerful tool for predicting rainfall more accurately and efficiently.</p>

    <h3>Machine Learning Techniques in Rainfall Prediction</h3>
    <p>Machine learning techniques can process vast amounts of historical weather data to predict future rainfall. Some
        commonly used ML techniques for rainfall prediction include:</p>
    <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
    <p>A simple regression technique that models the relationship between a dependent variable (rainfall) and one or
        more independent variables (temperature, humidity, etc.).
        Predicting short-term rainfall based on recent weather patterns.</p>
    <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
    <p>
        A non-linear model that splits the data into branches to predict the target variable.
        Classifying weather conditions to predict the likelihood of rainfall.
    </p>
    <h3>Random Forests</h3>
    <p>
        An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
        Predicting rainfall amounts by analyzing complex weather patterns.
    </p>
    <h3> Support Vector Machines (SVM)</h3>
    <p>A classification technique that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points.
        Classifying weather data into rainy or non-rainy days.</p>
    <h3> Neural Networks</h3>
    <p> Deep learning models that mimic the human brain to recognize patterns in large datasets.
        Long-term rainfall prediction using historical weather data.</p>
    <h3> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)</h3>
    <p> A simple algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its nearest neighbors. Predicting
        rainfall based on similarity to past weather events.
